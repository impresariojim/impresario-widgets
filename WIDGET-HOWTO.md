📌 How to Create & Publish a Widget (Step by Step)

Assumes you already have the HTML file ready.

🚩 Folder & File Setup

Open your repo folder:
impresario-widgets

Create a new folder for the widget.
The folder name = the final URL. Example:

barnsley-peers


Inside that folder, create a file named:

index.html


Paste your widget HTML into index.html.

📤 Commit & Push (GitHub Desktop)

Open GitHub Desktop → you should see the new folder & file.

Write a commit message, e.g.
Add barnsley-peers widget

Click Commit to main.

Then click Push origin.

🔍 Verify It Went Live

Your live site is at:

https://impresario-strategic.github.io/impresario-widgets/<folder-name>/


Example:

https://impresario-strategic.github.io/impresario-widgets/barnsley-peers/


⚠️ Important
If you see 404, wait 30–60 seconds — GitHub Pages sometimes needs a moment to deploy.

🚀 URL Format to Send to Clients
https://impresario-strategic.github.io/impresario-widgets/<widget-folder>/


You can email that link, embed it in a proposal, send it on WhatsApp, etc. No downloads. No friction.

🧠 Optional — Template Folder (For Fast Reuse)

Once you have 2–3 live widgets, create a folder called:

template-widget/


Inside, include:

index.html with placeholders (<!-- CLUB NAME HERE -->, etc.)

Any common styles/scripts

Then you can duplicate this folder anytime and fill in new data in minutes.

🧾 Your Current Repo Online

👉 Repo link:
https://github.com/impresario-strategic/impresario-widgets

🧩 What’s Next (When You’re Ready)

Add CSS to make it branded

Control width for mobile

Add loading animation

Add dropdown: Compare vs Peers / vs League Median

Add tooltips for explanations

But none of that is required to ship a working one tomorrow.
